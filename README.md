# Assignment 11

This is the readme for session-11. This file contains information for functions present in `polygon.py` and `polygon_seq.py`.

Polygons (sequence) type has been refactored into an iterable.

- Polygon class is in `polygon.py`.
- PolygonSeq class in `polygon_seq.py`.
- Both classses are tested in `main.ipynb`.

This session had the following topics -

#### > List Comprehensions

#### > Iterating Collections

#### > Iterators

#### > Iterators and Iterables

#### > Consuming Iterators Manually

#### > Cyclic Iterations

The starting point for this project is the Polygon class and the Polygons sequence type created in the previous session (10).
